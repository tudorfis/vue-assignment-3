TODO:
- lazy loading grids on big models
- make the border lines svg paths instead of divs
- make documentation for structure, drag and everything
- put gridLinks operations in different files, polymorphism on left/right/up/down
- fix the spliceCols/spliceRows problem when dragging a linked element between it's connections
- sort the gridModel.model.links so we don't have overlapping lines
