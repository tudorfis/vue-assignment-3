# vue-assignment-3

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

Potential Builds:
- lazy loading grids on big models
- make the border lines svg paths instead of divs
- make documentation for structure, drag and everything
- put gridLinks operations in different files, polymorphism on left/right/up/down
- fix the spliceCols/spliceRows problem when dragging a linked element between it's connections
- sort the gridModel.model.links so we don't have overlapping lines
